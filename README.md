In this repository, I have read in closing prices of four ETF investment options I am interested in from yahoo finance, and I perform some analysis on them to inform better on their performance and possible future outlook. 
I explore what outliers exists within the dataset and I handle missing values with missforest(). I also included some visuals to better understand and make decison easier.
